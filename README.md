## Build

The `algorithm` style is required by the paper. On Ubuntu based distributions, it's part of the `texlive-science` package.

```bash
$ pdflatex paper.tex && bibtex paper.aux && pdflatex paper.tex && pdflatex paper.tex
```

Or, more simply, install the `latexmk` package and run:

```bash
$ latexmk
```
